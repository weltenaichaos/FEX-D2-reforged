// vkd3d-proton (build 52). On a GPU with a single Vulkan queue family (Adreno), vkd3d-proton maps the game's direct,
// compute and copy queues onto one Vulkan queue. While two kinds of them were active in the last second it then
// "staggers" submissions: after each batch of command buffers its queue thread waits on the CPU until the previous batch
// has finished on the GPU, and it resolves the game's cross-queue fence waits on the CPU too. In D2R (it streams through a
// copy queue) the build 51 log showed vkd3d's queue thread blocked 80-95% of each frame in that wait (a KGSL timeline
// wait), and the GPU idle 11% of the time at its top clock in heavy scenes (36 ms frames at 680 MHz, busy 89%). vkd3d's
// VKD3D_CONFIG flag no_staggered_submit submits each ExecuteCommandLists in one go and leaves the waits to the GPU;
// upstream already sets it for Unreal Engine games and others.
//
//   FEX_VKD3D_NOSTAGGER=1  add no_staggered_submit to VKD3D_CONFIG in the process environment (the D2R default)
//   FEX_VKD3D_NOSTAGGER=0  leave VKD3D_CONFIG alone
